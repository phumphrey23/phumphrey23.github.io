When I first started the Fullstack Web Development program, I got on board with the IDE that Learn.co provided.  It's very easy to install and seamless funtionality of using it with the labs is what kept me using it.  However, every instructor or tech specialist I had come across used something other than the Learn IDE.  I knew eventually I would need to transition to an outside IDE or text editor/terminal set-up.

**Learn IDE**

There are a few advantages of using the Learn IDE.  My favorite features include the "Open IDE" button for labs.  It saves you the time of forking and cloning the lab from github.  I also like the ability to run test by typing in "learn" in the terminal.  It saves the time of typing in the full file name.  Having the terminal, file browser, and text editor in the same environment is the best part.  I only realized the convenience of all this now because I recently transitioned to using Atom paired with my terminal.

**Transitioning to Atom**

The Learn IDE is based from Atom, the open source text editor developed by Github.  I downloaded it around the same time I started this program to see which I'd find easier to use.  I had no clue what I was doing.  It's stayed dorment among all my other applications while I got used to using the Learn IDE.  I was starting my CLI Data Gem Project and watched a walkthrough video of Avi bulding a gem.  Guess what he's using...Atom.  It was a little hard to follow Avi's workflow using the IDE, so I decided it was time to give Atom another shot.

I vastly underestimated what I was getting myself into.
