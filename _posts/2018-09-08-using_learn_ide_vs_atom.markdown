When I first started the Fullstack Web Development program, I got on board with the IDE that Learn.co provided.  It's very easy to install and seemless funtionality of using it with the labs is what kept me using it.  However, I knew eventually I would need to transition to an outside IDE or text editor/terminal set-up.  Every instructor or tech specialist I had come across used something other than the Learn IDE.
